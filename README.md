# Sourdough
My process for creating sourdough. Grab a fork and let's go!

# Day before
The day before making the dough, you want to ensure your starter is healthy and active. Give a feeding both in the morning and ~10 hours later, or when the starter begins to fall back into itself. This schedule will ensure that the starter is ready for another feeding when we plan to build the levan. Speaking of which...

# Build the Levan - 9am
This little mini-dough, if you will, ensures your yeast and accompanying bateria (the good kind) are active and ready to ferment. When creating your levan there are two main things to note; how much starter to innoculate with, and temperature.

The more starter you add to the leavn the more yeast it adds, however, it also brings more acid to the party. And the more acid that is in the starter, the more acid is brought into the dough. Acid gives the dough a stronger sharper flavor, contributing to that classic sourdough characteristic. Acid also tightens gluten. The more acid brought into the dough will make it more `Elastic` and less `Extensible`. You can use this to your advantage, depending on what bread you are making. If you are making a baguette, for instance, you would want a more extensible dough that can be shaped more easily. So you would reduce the amount of starter used to innoculate the levan with. For the purpose of this recipe, we are creating a boule so we want to keep some elasticity to hold it's shape.

The second thing to note is the temperature, both the temperature of the water and the environment it will ferment in. Warmer tempertatures of each will lead to faster fermentation. You can use this to build a recipe that fits around your schedule. If your levan will reach it's peak fermentation while you're still at work, you can add colder water or keep it in a colder area of your kitchen to retard your levan.

Once your starter has begun to fall back, in a mason jar combine:
```
 * 75 grams of starter
 * 200 grams of 50/50 (whole wheat/bread flour) blend
 * 200 grams of water (85)
```
