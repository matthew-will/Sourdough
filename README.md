# Sourdough
My process for creating sourdough. Grab a fork and let's go!

# Day before
The day before making the dough, you want to ensure your starter is healthy and active. Give a feeding both in the morning and ~10 hours later, or when the starter begins to fall back into itself. This schedule will ensure that the starter is ready for another feeding when we plan to build the levan. Speaking of which...

# Build the Levan - 9am
This little mini-dough ensures our yeast and accompanying bateria (the good kind) are alive, active, and ready to eat. When creating your levan there are two main things to note; the leavn's temperature and how much starter to innoculate with.

The more starter added to the leavn, the more yeast. However, it also brings more acid to the party. The more acid that is in the starter, the more acid will be brought into final bread. Resulting in a stronger, sharper, and classic sourdough flavor. Acid also tightens gluten making the dough more `Elastic` and less `Extensible`. You can use this to your advantage, depending on what bread you are making. If you are making a baguette, for instance, you would want a more extensible dough that can be shaped more easily. So you would reduce the amount of starter used to innoculate the levan with. For the purpose of this recipe, we are creating a boule so we want to keep some elasticity to hold it's shape.

The second thing to note is the temperature, both the temperature of the water and the environment it will ferment in. Warmer tempertatures of each will lead to faster fermentation. You can use this to build a recipe that fits around your schedule. If your levan will reach it's "peak fermentation" while you're still at work, you can add colder water or keep it in a colder area of your kitchen to retard your levan so it will be ready when you are. 

Once your starter has begun to fall back into itself from the previous night's feeding, combine the following in a clean mason jar:
```
 * 75 grams of starter
 * 200 grams of 50/50 (whole wheat/bread flour) blend
 * 200 grams of water (85)
```
Mix to combine, cover with a towel, and place in your oven (off) with the oven light on. As an extra saftey procaution against others accidently turning on the oven and killing your precious starter, lock your oven. Depending on your oven, this will fire a warning before allowing someone to turn on the oven which could, in turn, save your yeast. 

# Autolyse - know how to use it
An autolyse is a rest step of just water and flour that sits anywhere from 20 minutes to even 8 hours. The autolyse does a couple of really cool things for our dough. First, it allows the flour to fully hydrate, and second it kicks off the enzymatic activity of two important enzymes - `Protease` and `Amalyse`. 

`Protease` helps to make your dough more `extensible` by gently breaking down some of the gluten that's forming as the dough hydrates while resting. This weakens the dough's `elasticity`, thereby increasing its `extensibility`. The longer the autolyse the more protease has an affect on the dough. So to put it simply, the longer the autolyse, the more `extensible` your dough will be.

`Amylase` turns the starch molecules in flour into glucose. This conversion of starch to sugar allows for greater fermentation, better browning, and greater residual sugar in the finished loaf. Not too bad.

Once you notice your levan is starting to double in size, start making the dough. In a large bowl combine:
```
* 900 grams of bread flour
* 100 grams of whole wheat flour
* 700 grams of water (85°)
```
Mix until you don't see any dry flour bits. Cover with a towel, and place in your oven with the oven light on for 2 hours. As a note, enzymatic activity is temperature sensitive, the warmer the ambient temperature of the dough, the faster the enzymes will work. So a 2 hour autolyse in a warm environment will experience greater effects from `Protease` and `Amalyse` than in a cooler environment. 

This step should be timed so that the levan is 2 hours away from "peak fermenation", when the yeast will be most active.

# Initial Mix
After two hours take the dough and levan out of the oven. You will notice how much the texture of the dough has changed as a result of the autolyse, much more easy to stretch out without the dough tearing. You can see how much gluten was built in just 2 hours of rest. 

I like to build even more gluten at this stage and mix the dough, for 5 minutes, rest for 10, then mix for an additonal 5 minutes. With you hand in the shape of a hook, reach under the dough stretch upwards then slap it back down onto itself, repeat. You are stretching the dough to develop more gluten while also helping to incorporate air into the dough.

After mixing, its time to add the levan and start the bulk fermentation. Combine the water and salt and stir to combine.

```
* 200 grams of levan
* 50 grams of water (85°)
* 20 grams of salt
```

Spread levan ontop of the dough. Pour the water/salt mixture over and begin to incorporate. It will seem like it shouldn't go together, but it will, eventually. Use your fingers and squeeze the dough, breaking it up. This will help to incorporate the salt into the dough.

# a note about salt
Salt in dough not only makes the bread taste better, but also (similar to acid from the starter) tightens gluten, making the dough more elastic.

Once the dough has been mixed thouroughly, cover and place in your oven with the oven light on and rest for 30 minutes.
