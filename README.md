# Sourdough
My process for creating sourdough. Grab a fork and let's go!


# Levan
This is the food for your dough. A mini-dough, if you will, that proves the viability of your yeast starter before adding it to the dough. 

```
 * 75 grams of starter
 * 200 grams of 50/50 (whole wheat/bread flour) blend
 * 200 grams of water (85)
```
